________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

2.0 Safety improvements

A   In order to authenticate and verify the security algorithm used XXTEA session Cookies. The essence of the method
    implementation:

    1. In the session is added REMOTE_ADDR to block repeated requests;
    2. Serialize $_SESS array into serialized string;
    3. Serialized string is encrypted using a randomly selected XXTEA with &ldquo;salt&rdquo; for the site;
    4. Encrypting a string is passed to the Cookies named `session`.

    What it gives?

    Protection against CSRF and open view of identification user data. In order to properly encrypt data and send them
    fraudulent manner, you need a &ldquo;salt&rdquo; and the IP address of the sender. Salt is unique for each site and set consists
    of a 512-bit encryption. The probability of selection of the cipher salt is actually zero. Each time you update a
    random number issued to confirm the return to the user, which is stored in an encrypted session.

    You also can not resend the same token to another IP-address, since the encrypted data is IP-address of the sender
    and any attempt to send the wrong line leads to unlogin.

    However, nothing can protect any data from the session, and &ldquo;listening&rdquo; to, if not using a secure https-connection.
    To install it you have to buy a registrar certificate for your domain. Read more here
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure

B   CAPTCHA

    The main problem in the web space is still spam. For writing news comments and for account registration captcha has
    been added, which uses session encryption mechanism through the Cookies, so that hacking by robot is impossible,
    too. The information is stored securely.

C   A function cleaning almost every XSS written by an offender in the comments or posts has been created.

D   Enhanced protection from the folder view with .htaccess has been added.

    need to be completed.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.0 The use of embedded code

    CuteNews has been designed to provide the most convenient process of embedding code into the site.
    The server must support PHP to run the script. The launch is to be made in a file of php extension accordingly.

    An example of embedding code:

    /folder/where/located/yourfile.php

        +---------------------------------------------------+
        | &lt;html> &lt;head> .... &lt;body> ... YOUR SITE           |
        | ...                                               |
        | &lt;?php CN_INCLUDE1; ?>                             |
        | ...                                               |
        |                         +----------------------+  |
        | Content                 | &lt;?php CN_INCLUDE2;?> |  |
        | Content                 |                      |  |
        | Content                 |                      |  |
        |                         |                      |  |
        |                         +----------------------+  |
        |                                                   |
        | +-----------------------------------------------+ |
        | + Footer         &lt;?php CN_INCLUDE3;?>           + |
        | +-----------------------------------------------+ |
        +---------------------------------------------------+

    Page layout is selected arbitrarily here. There are three CN_INCLUDE blocks. Every block is placed separately and it
    shows a defined template, which was selected in the parameters of its show. For example, CN_INCLUDE1 block shows
    full type news, CN_INCLUDE2 - static news, CN_INCLUDE3 - archives of the headlines pattern.

    When clicking the &ldquo;Read More&rdquo; or &ldquo;Comments&rdquo; links, the usual page update is provided, but with the transfer of other
    parameters.

    If the module is static, then the changes in his body will not happen; if it is dynamic, as CN_INCLUDE1, the
    corresponding content will be shown. This means that if there is subaction=showcomments in a GET-query, the template
    will be changed to full news with comments.

    This is the simplest way to embed news. If you are an experienced php user, you can make more changes in the same
    block, as well as modify block options depending on the data taking from the GET/POST query.


5.1 How to embed news

    First of all, check the files and folders structure on the server. It is better to use absolute paths, if possible.

    For example:

    - /home/userdir/www/news/           - There is code of the CuteNews Administration Panel saved in this folder.
    - /home/userdir/www/my_script.php   - This folder contains script, which we call.

    my_script.php:

        <code>&lt;html>&lt;body>&lt;h1>Hi, World!&lt;/h1> &lt;?php include ('/home/userdir/www/news/show_news.php'); ?> &lt;/body>&lt;/html></code>

    Using this example code, you will call the correct script and the build-in news will be successfully displayed.
    Please note that the script show_news.php can't be called directly! In the case of calling it directly you will
    face the 503 error.


5.2 Options for embedding news

    Before to turn on the show_news.php script the following options can be set:

    $_GET['ucat']       - news category index. Show news from the specified categories only;
    $static             - allows to show only active news;
    $category           - list of allowed categories;
    $template           - template name;
    $reverse            - show news in the reverse order;
    $sortbylastcom      - order news by last comment;
    $archive            - use archive ID;
    $only_active        - if =true is selected, only active news without archives are shown;
    $number             - number of news (there are 10 by default);
    $no_prev            - if =true is selected, do not use &lt;&lt; Prev link;
    $no_next            - if =true is selected, do not use Next >> link;
    $start_from         - skip some news by specific number;
    $static_path        - set the static paths of all the links (e.g. comments link, fullstory link, etc) included in
                          the show_news.php;

    $user_by            - if this option is selected, only news of specified user will be shown;


5.3 Archives

    Archives are displayed in the same way as news. In the absence of the $archive option a list of archives will be
    displayed. It is important to remember that the embedded code with the archives will display full story, if certain
    parameters are passed.

    It is recommended to hidden the direct code inclusion with archives and to install static=true, if it is placed in
    the sidebar.

    For example:

        The code <code>&lt;?php include ('show_archives.php'); ?></code> is embedded into the sidebar.
        If you click the &ldquo;Read more&rdquo; link, the full news will  be displayed in the sidebar instead of list of archives.

5.4 RSS

    RSS feed can be configured via Administration Panel in the Options > Integration Wizards >
    RSS Setup and Integration.

    It is necessary to follow the instructions which are presented in the Wizards.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.5 Search function

5.5.1 Embedding search form

    This can be done in two ways:

    1) By using the code <code>&lt;?php include('search.php'); ?></code>

        If =true for the $search_form_hide option is selected before include('search.php'), the form of the search
        query will not be displayed in search results.

    2) By placing an arbitrary search form  anywhere

        <code>&lt;form action="url_where_the code_is"> and insert this code where you want to see the search results:
        &lt;?php if ($_REQUEST['do'] == "search" or $_REQUEST['dosearch'] == "yes")
                 { $subaction = "search"; $dosearch = "yes"; include("search.php"); } ?></code>

    Once the values  $do = 'search' и dosearch = 'yes' have been shown in the URL- or Post query, search results will
    be displayed.

5.5.2 Search algorithm description

    Search function partly supports fulltext in the simplified search algorithm.
    The search algorithm works as follows:

    1. All the frequencies of words can be found in the active news or in the selected archive;
    2. For each found word frequency of all words is formed;
    3. For the active news the result is being sorted in the order of increasing frequency of all words included in the
       document.

    Just take for example &ldquo;find the bug&rdquo; search query.

    The following words can be found in the document: &ldquo;find&rdquo; (3 times), &ldquo;the&rdquo; (0 times), &ldquo;bug&rdquo; (4 times).

        News 1: find (1)       - 1
        News 4: bug(3)         - 3
        News 8: find(2) bug(1) - 2+1 = 3

    Sorting the result, we find the least rare word in the document (News 1).
    The algorithm has a drawback in that it ignores the request with a not occurring word.

5.6 Facebook comments form

    To start using this form you need to add your Facebook AppID to the Options > System Configurations > Facebook.

    It is possible to embed Facebook comments form by adding the following META-tag:

        <code>&lt;meta property="fb:admins" content="012345678901234"/></code>

    inside the &lt;head> tag to the pattern displayed on the web site. Where 012345678901234 is a numeric user ID on
    Facebook. Embedding this meta tag allows you to administer comments.

5.7 Custom date formatting

    Insert code {month} into the pattern - the month will be shown in English.

    Or use {month|jan,feb,....,dec} - listing of the months' titles is required.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.0 Internal hooks and their use

    This section is for developers only.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

7.0 Plug-ins

    Plug-in files are loaded from the folder ./cdata/plugins every time you call a page that uses the CuteNews engine.
    It is necessary to register internal hooks for plug-ins by using the callback-functions.

    Use add_hook function to add a hook:

    <code>&lt;?php // Plug-in code
        add_hook('system_modules_expand', 'myPluginSystem');
        function myPluginSystem($modules) { return $modules; }
    ?></code>

    myPluginSystem function won't work properly without adding a hook.

    All plugins located at /cdata/plugins directory with *.php extension.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

8.0 Standard forms for the web site news construction

    The preliminary testing information: CuteNews is installed in the catalog: /home/yoursite/www/cnews.


8.1 The simplest form

    Script location: yoursite.com/index.php
    Code:

        ...
        <code>&lt;?php include ('cnews/show_news.php'); ?></code>
        ...

    This allows to show the active news. By clicking the comments form or the &ldquo;Read more&rdquo; link you will see the full
    text of an article with the comments.


8.2 News are displayed in another folder

    Absolute server path:   /home/yoursite/www/
    Script location:        yoursite.com/mynews/index.php

    Code:

        ...
        <code>&lt;?php include ('/home/yoursite/www/cnews/show_news.php'); ?></code>
        ...

    This allows to show active news in the same folder from which they are called.


8.3 Display news from every block at the main web page.

    For example, the box with Headlines templates is available in the sidebar or footer. These blocks can be called by
    using the $static = true option. It is necessary to display news at the main web page by clicking the Sidebar link.

    File 1:

        Absolute server path:   /home/yoursite/www/
        Script location:        yoursite.com/pages/lines/index.php

        Code embedded in the sidebar:

        <code>&lt;?php $static = true;
              $static_path = '/index.php';
              $template = 'Headlines';
              include ('/home/yoursite/www/cnews/show_news.php'); ?></code>

    File 2:

        Absolute server path:   home/yoursite/www/
        Script location:        yoursite.com/index.php

        Code embedded in the sidebar:

            <code>&lt;?php include ('/home/yoursite/www/cnews/show_news.php'); ?></code>

8.4 The search form is embedded in the sidebar, but you need to display search results in the news block:

    <code>&lt;form action="URL, where you want the search results to be displayed">

        &lt;input type="hidden" name="dosearch" value="yes" />  &lt;!-- indication of $dosearch option required -->
        &lt;input type="text" name="story" value="" />          &lt;!-- specify the search form -->

    &lt;/form></code>

    In the script where search is being performed allow search by dosearch

        <code>&lt;?php if ( isset($_REQUEST['dosearch']) && $_REQUEST['dosearch'] = 'yes')
                   include ('/home/yoursite/www/cnews/search.php'); ?></code>

    If hidden of the search form is required, you will need to add $search_form_hide:

        <code>&lt;?php if ( isset($_REQUEST['dosearch']) && $_REQUEST['dosearch'] = 'yes')
                 {
                    $search_form_hide = true;
                    include ('/home/yoursite/www/cnews/search.php');
                 } ?></code>
